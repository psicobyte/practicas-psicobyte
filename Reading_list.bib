@article{Racz2014,
abstract = {Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease leading to alveolar bone destruction, and eventually tooth loss. In genetically or environmentally predisposed individuals periodontopathogenic bacteria trigger an inflammatory immune response where activated macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines and T helper 17 cells produce interleukin-17, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$. Inflammation and the production of RANKL, the key cytokine responsible for osteoclast activation, cause excessive activation of osteoclasts. This results in a decoupling between bone formation and resorption, leading to bone loss. As conventional treatment does not target the inflammatory response and osteoclast activation, its effectiveness is limited. Novel treatments are thus required if we are to cure this disease. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including those of dental origin, are potent immunomodulators and are known to be suitable for tissue regeneration. MSCs can inhibit the immune response by suppressing T cells, inducing regulatory T cells and converting dendritic cells and macrophages into a regulatory phenotype. Additionally, genetic modulation may enhance the therapeutic potential of MSCs. In the present review the authors describe the potential use of MSCs, either unmodified or engineered for therapeutic purposes in periodontitis, with special emphasis on MSCs from dental pulp and periodontal ligament. The paper envisions that multiple targeting of this inflammatory disease by modulating the immune response, promoting bone regeneration and inhibiting bone resorption might yield significantly improved treatment outcomes when combined with conventional treatment modalities.},

@article{Foudah2014,
abstract = {The spontaneous expression of neural markers, already demonstrated in bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has been considered as evidence of the MSCs' predisposition to differentiate toward neural lineages, supporting their use in stem cell-based therapy for neural repair. In this study we have evaluated, by immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry experiments, the expression of neural markers in undifferentiated MSCs from different sources: human adipose stem cells (hASCs), human skin-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hS-MSCs), human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs,) and human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). Our results demonstrate that the neuronal markers $\beta$ III-tubulin and NeuN, unlike other evaluated markers, are spontaneously expressed by a very high percentage of undifferentiated hASCs, hS-MSCs, hPDLSCs, and hDPSCs. Conversely, the neural progenitor marker nestin is expressed only by a high percentage of undifferentiated hPDLSCs and hDPSCs. Our results suggest that the expression of $\beta$ III-tubulin and NeuN could be a common feature of stem cells and not exclusive to neuronal cells. This could result in a reassessment of the use of $\beta$ III-tubulin and NeuN as the only evidence proving neuronal differentiation. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the relevance of the spontaneous expression of these markers in stem cells.},

@article{Ka2014,
abstract = {Human mesenchymal stem/precursor cells (MSC) are similar to some other stem/progenitor cells in that they compact into spheres when cultured in hanging drops or on nonadherent surfaces. Assembly of MSC into spheres alters many of their properties, including enhanced secretion of factors that mediate inflammatory and immune responses. Here we demonstrated that MSC spontaneously aggregated into sphere-like structures after injection into a subcutaneous air pouch or the peritoneum of mice. The structures were similar to MSC spheres formed in cultures demonstrated by the increased expression of genes for inflammation-modulating factors TSG6, STC1, and COX2, a key enzyme in production of PGE2. To identify the signaling pathways involved, hanging drop cultures were used to follow the time-dependent changes in the cells as they compacted into spheres. Among the genes upregulated were genes for the stress-activated signaling pathway for IL1$\alpha$/$\beta$, and the contact-dependent signaling pathway for Notch. An inhibitor of caspases reduced the upregulation of IL1A/B expression, and inhibitors of IL1 signaling decreased production of PGE2, TSG6, and STC1. Also, inhibition of IL1A/B expression and secretion of PGE2 negated the anti-inflammatory effects of MSC spheres on stimulated macrophages. Experiments with $\gamma$-secretase inhibitors suggested that Notch signaling was also required for production of PGE2 but not TSG6 or STC1. The results indicated that assembly of MSC into spheres triggers caspase-dependent IL1 signaling and the secretion of modulators of inflammation and immunity. Similar aggregation in vivo may account for some of the effects observed with administration of the cells in animal models.},

@article{DeAraujoFarias2013,
abstract = {We have investigated the capacity of activated carbon cloth to support the growth and differentiation of human mesenchymal umbilical-cord stromal stem cells. Our results demonstrate that this scaffold provides suitable conditions for the development of cell-derived matrix proteins and facilitates the growth of undifferentiated stem cells with the ability to induce osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. Immunoflourescence staining revealed extensive expression of collagen in all the samples, and collagen type II and osteopontin within the samples cultivated in specific differentiation-inducing media. Cell growth and the formation of natural collagen, calcium-magnesium carbonate and hydroxyapatite crystals, together with the self-assemblage of collagen to produce suprafibrillar arrangements of fibrils all occur simultaneously and can be studied together ex vivo under physiological conditions. Furthermore, the spontaneous differentiation of stem cells cultured on activated carbon cloth with no osteogenic supplements opens up new possibilities for bone-tumour engineering and treatment of traumatic and degenerative bone diseases. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},
